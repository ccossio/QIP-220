### Motivation
* Grow QiDAO presence in frontier markets with a focus in Latin America and South East Asia, specifically in Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
* QiDAO community can participate and have access to Meta Pool DAO grants 

mpETH wants to empower users from frontier markets to be able to engage with Decentralized Finance, we acknowledge that QiDAO has a large user base in these regions and the Meta Pool DAO wants to support it´s growth. Working to onboard millions of users.

mpETH is a non-rebasing liquid staking token (LST), which means the scenario of depeged priced is reduced and does not need a wrapping to accrue staking rewards, plus the calculation of the accruing rewards is done every second. Coingecko page: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mpeth

Currently mpETH as a boosted APY of more than 5%, which is supported by the SSV Network protocol rewards; which will be accruing for the next 12 months. Rewards are on ETH, we avoid double token rewards. 

Meta Pool is partnering with Linea and their ecosystem, we are build a go to market strategy to expand usage of Linea. There is full alignment from investors such as Dragonfly and IOSG. The first 3 months Meta Pool DAO will be providing liquidity on the Lynex DEX and working with QiDAO to support MAI liquidity pools, provide incentives for their growth and promotion on the current user base of more than 13,000 community members.

Meta Pool DAO is commiting ETH staking rewards fees to be distributed to blockchain projects in emerging markets; they are allocating the first 2000 ETH to this initiative. 

For now they are running programs with Gitcoin, participating in Gitcoin Round 18 (GR18) for LATAM projects and GR19 to the Global Chinese Community.

Currenly running a campaign with Giveth to support projects in the APAC region and looking to engage the QiDAO community to have access to this Quadratic Funding round.

In their current Meta Pool DAO grant Round N.6 they are currently allocating more than $20,000 USD to support projects in emerging markets, which will also be open for the QiDAO community to participate in. More information: (https://www.metapool.app/grants)
